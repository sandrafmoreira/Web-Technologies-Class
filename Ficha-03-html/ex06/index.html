    <h3>5 MYTHS ABOUT BOOKING A FLIGHT THAT YOU NEED TO IGNORE</h3>
    <img src="./images/blog_article.jpg" alt="" width="500px">
    <p><b>Last Updated:</b></p>
    <p>8/28/23 | August 28th, 2023</p>
    <p>
        Let’s talk about cheap flights. We all know airlines are out to screw us over — and no one wants to be the person who gets stuck paying the highest fare. That’s why we spend hours upon hours researching articles on airfare, trying to game the system like we’re attempting to outsmart a used car salesman.
    </p>
    <p>
        <a href="https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-tips/how-to-find-a-cheap-flight/">I’ve written about finding a cheap flight before</a>
        — and even 
        <a href="https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-blogs/booking-a-cheap-airfare-online/">my process for booking a flight</a>
        — but today I want to talk about some persistent and inaccurate myths about booking a flight that have stuck around through simple inertia and lazy journalism.
        <br><br>
        There are a lot of articles out there that list “secret hacks” claiming to save you thousands. “If you book a flight on a Tuesday during a blood moon while standing on one leg, you’ll get the cheapest flight possible!”
        <br><br>
        Ok, that’s an exaggeration. But I read so many articles that are straight-up inaccurate and outdated that, today, I want to explain which “rules” are straight-up lies so you don’t follow them, save hours of time, and still end up with a cheap flight!
